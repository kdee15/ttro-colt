      <p>Mark Beeden (a Coltie expert) explains:</p>
      <p>Good communication is all about driving action. Youâ€™re trying to change thought processes, beliefs and behaviours so your communication needs to be aimed at communicating change.</p>
      <p>Before you start, you should know exactly what message you want to communicate so that your information and purpose is delivered as clearly as possible.</p>
